# GT-GI130-ERP-XLSX-WRITE
ERP XLSX file Writer by Yew Choon Min

This is a Python File which will generate 5 XLSX files which is suitable to be uploaded to my current company's ERP system.
I created this project to help out my team in registering new ERP registration as manual copying of these files would normally take 20 minutes to 
change the part numbers and also manually check each data. I also take this as project to improve my own coding skills.


The python file will prompt user for:
1.Part Number
2.Part Description(Capital Letter)
3.ECO number

The python file will generate 5 files which will be ready to upload to ERP system:
1.Part Master
2.Part Revision
3.Part Revision with Attachment
4.BOO
5.BOM

Further improvement for this project is to increase user-friendliness to use this program, and also making it easily modifiable to suit different needs.
